The logos are stored in the directory 100x100/. Smaller versions of the logos
are created automatically from the files in 100x100/. If you want to override
the automatically scaled versions, you can put files in 44x44/ and 16x16/,
but this is not necessary unless you have edited the smaller versions
manually.

The original/ catalog is used to store the originals for the logos for
future reference. This catalog is not used in the update process.

After updating a logo, send an email to mattias and ask him to
push the updated version to tv.swedb.se.
